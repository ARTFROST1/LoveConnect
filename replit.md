4. User profile is created or retrieved from local storage

### Partner Connection
1. User generates deep-link invite via Telegram Bot API (@duolove_bot)
2. Partner clicks link â†’ Telegram Bot receives /start invite_{user_id}  
3. Bot launches WebApp with start_param containing invitation data
4. WebApp automatically processes invitation using useInviteProcessing hook
5. Bidirectional partnership created in both users' local SQLite databases
6. Success notification shown with haptic feedback
7. Both users can immediately start playing games together

### Game Sessions
1. User selects game from categorized list
2. Game session is created in local database
3. Game state is managed locally with periodic saves
4. Results are stored upon completion with scoring data

### Data Synchronization
